This table will display each African country's number of years since their first competitive election, indicate whether they have experienced uninterrupted democracy, and show the duration of their current continuous democratic governance. The closer the alignment between the years since the first competitive election and the duration of uninterrupted democracy, the more developed the country's democracy is. <br><br>\n\nAdditionally, explore a timeline of Africa's democratic evolution, presented through a map that highlights the duration of uninterrupted democracy in each country. This metric reflects how long each nation has successfully maintained democratic governance without military coups or authoritarian rule. By factoring in multiparty elections and the absence of coups, the map provides a comprehensive view of the democratic progress across the continent. <br><br>\n\nFind out which African nations boast the longest-standing democratic practices. These visuals are  crucial for assessing the maturity and effectiveness of democratic systems across Africa.",

Many upcoming elections are in countries that aren't true democracies and are therefore unlikely to result in any change. Across Africa, democracy is still a very young system of governance, and in many countries, it's floundering. In a 2023 survey of 54k Africans across 38 countries, only 39.2% of respondents were somewhat or very satisfied with democracy. This is down from 49.6% in 2012. This dissatisfaction could lead to greater civil unrest and the return of more military regimes. \ufeffThere have already been 9 coups since 2020. Additionally, the impact of the elections should be considered through the lens of how many people are impacted (country population size) and the size of the economy each leader is responsible for shaping (GDP).",
